# SurfsUp_Challenge

The purpose of this project is to produce an analyis of temperature trends in Oahu, Hawaii. By gathering summary statistics of temperature data fore the months of June and December, we are able to determine if a prospective surf and ice cream shop business can sustainably operate all year as opposed to only certain times of the year.

Using our analysis, we are able to see some of our results:

Summary of our Findings

In conclusion, I believe our results find that ideally the surf and ice cream shop is able to operate all year. The highest June frequency is around 75 degrees fahrenheit and the highest December frequency is around 71 degrees fahrenheit. This is only a difference of 4 degrees fahrenheit between the months. Also notable, the highest frequency of recorded temps almost mimicks the average temperature for each of those months. The average temperature in June is 74.94 degrees fahrenheit. The average temperature in December is 71.04 degrees fahrenheit. Our model shows that it is sustainable to have the surf and ice cream shop open all year.
